			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

1. -- in thread.h ----------------
 int64_t tick_wakeup; 

 //Added a struct member for thread struct which indicate when to wakeup (set when putting the thread to blocked state) 

2. -- in thread.c ----------------
 static struct list sleep_list;

 // Defined a static list to store the sleeping threads.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

timer_sleep method call thread_sleep method to put the current thread to sleep for
specific amount of time. Then, the thread is set to THREAD_BLOCKED state instead of
yeilding the CPU (how it is previously implemented). So, this prevent busy waiting.

timer_interrupt is a function which is responsible of incrementing the tick counter.
Each time the timer_interrupt called thread_awake method is set to be called.
thread_awake looks for threads in sleep_list and wake up the threads whose tick_wakeup
are expired.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

thread_awake is only function which is implemented to be called inside timer_interrupt. 
For minimize the time spent in timer interrupt handler maintain the sleep_list as ordered list (ascending order of tick_wakeup).
If a thread found with tick_wakeup greater than current immediately break the loop
instead of checking for all threads.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

ASSERT(intr_get_level() == INTR_ON)
condition checks for interrupt level before calling the critical thread_sleep method.
So, it avoid

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts. You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the semester.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future semesters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
